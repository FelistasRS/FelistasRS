- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Felistas
-So basically this was supposed to be full stack ,covering both front and back end
-However only Backend (and a bit of frontend) are used in this project
-PHP for all calculations
-Use of mysql and databases
-Specific data is called to browser
-Great use of css *especially with shopping cart
                  *sticky nav-bar and shopping cart
                  *color co-odination
                  *Placement/positioning of items on browser
-No use of table to showcase data-base (containers instead)
